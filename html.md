## what is HTML

its stands for ***HyperText Markup Language*** and its user tages to structure page and every tag of them have particular job to and some tag act like a continar and its till what in side it.

## some tags in HTML

- body: its the tag that contine all the magic that the user will see.
- head: its have the informtion about the page:
                         - the title of the page
                         - description of the page
                         - words for search engine
                         - some sorce the page will need it to work
- and also there is inline and block elements;

inline | block
-------|-------
<a>    | <h1>
<b>    | <p>
<em>   | <ul>
<img>  | <li>

#### inline element will display at the same line
#### block element will  display in new line

- div: its a continar for other elemnt
- iframe: its the small window that will show you other pages in your page like maps

##### in traditnal HTML layout was every thing in side a div as a contienr until the HTML 5 appears with new tags that make your code more organized like:

- header: the top part of your page.
- footer: the last part of your page.
- nav: the container of your links to navigate
- aside: the side part of your page.
- section: its contain every part of your page separately.
- hgroup: its containe all your main heading part inn one part.
and more.
